{"id":"1","title":"On Average","blog":"Learning from “On Average” podcast is the importance of understanding you audience’s needs. In web development, understanding the demographics, their behaviour and preference as per who will be target audience. By understanding average target user, developer or designer have to developed website. To follow along with user details, go through by user research, analyzing web traffic, checking user interface to ensure website is understandable and able to carry traffic. So, we have discussed with client, Analyst Design and then proceed for development.\r\nDevelopers have to always open for new adventure coming in the market instead of sticking on old, because something is worked before but it’s not mandatory it will work in future; Software in the market to make human life easy; so, we have to careful with security of user personal information and also keep learning from past experience. We also have to think in broadly to maximise our users for our website.\r\nPodcast mention idea of an “Average human” is a damaged concept, as no one person can truly an average human. So as my view is no any website design for single person. And also, no any website can meet needs of every user; Developer aims to create a website that are flexible and adaptable, offering a range of features and options that can be fulfill to individual users need.\r\nPodcase mention the importance of nature and appreciation in design. So, the time user spending on our website they feel to be pleased due to aesthetics of design it helps to increase user time and help to gain trust.\r\nCreate balance and harmony in visual compositions. Selection of each element, fonts, color and design will interpreting data followed by content of the website. Importance of creativity and innovation in any field is required especially in web development where new technology and trends are constantly involving. Developers must be willing to try new approaches, check out new ideas and their limitations as basis on functional and interaction.\r\nIn conclusion, “On average” we can learn from past development and make today’s world better and as per todays problem and complexity in market something change will be necessary for tomorrow.","image":null,"link":"https:\/\/99percentinvisible.org\/episode\/on-average\/","created_at":"2023-04-14 19:38:32","updated_at":"2023-04-15 16:32:57"},
{"id":"2","title":"How blind programmer code??? Let’s make accessible web for blind","blog":"Web development involves creating websites and web applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including those with disabilities. Ensuring that websites are accessible to blind individuals for example, Content should be compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.\r\nThe use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers or braille displays, speech recognition and keyboard shortcuts, has a significant impact on web development, making it more accessible to blind programmers. These tools allow blind programmers to navigate web pages, access and modify source code, and interact with user interfaces in a way that equivalent to sighted developers. Web developer should consider accessibility as a key aspect of their work means, design websites that are easy to navigate, have clear and concise content and compatible with assistive technology.\r\nBy using text editors or IDE that support accessibility features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, indentation, error checking, blind programmers can write and edit code more efficiently, without relying on visual cues. Additionally, Audio cues or sound effects can help blind programmers identify errors, breakpoints and warnings; it will help to improving the debugging process. Debugging tools that provide verbal feedback or output can further enhance the debugging process by providing blind programmers with an audible description of code’s behavior.\r\nCollaboration and code review are essential parts of the development process, so blind people use version control system that allow blind programmers to participate in these activities like work with other developers, merge changes and resolve conflicts, ensuring that their contribution are integrated smoothly in to the project. Use of some accessible online resources such as documentation, tutorials, podcasts can help blind programmer getting knowledge about new languages, libraries and frameworks.  These resources can be made accessible by audio, video or by ensuring the content is formatted correctly for screen readers.\r\nOnline communities and forums that cater to blind programmers can provide a space for blind programmers to connect, share knowledge and collaborate on project. Learning from other blind programmer who have experience, expertise, advice and mentorship help to grow another blind programmer.\r\nIn summary, the importance of accessibility in web development and reminds developers to consider the needs of all users including those with disabilities. The use of assistive technologies and accessible resources has a significant impact on web development, making able to use for blind programmers. By leveraging these tool and resources blind programmers can contribute their talent, knowledge to the development of web applications and software in a meaningful and impactful way.","image":null,"link":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/118984\/how-can-you-program-if-youre-blind","created_at":"2023-04-14 19:38:32","updated_at":"2023-04-15 16:34:13"},
{"id":"3","title":"“The Curb-Cut”","blog":"The “Curb-cut effect” is the term that refers to how laws and programs that help disabled groups of people including emotionally or physically often help everyone.

{"id":"5","title":"“Accessibility according to actual people with disabilities”","blog":"The accessibility of the website and web applications is impacted by a number of important issues that are highlighted by actual persons with disabilities. As a result, it is lot to do with web development, as developers are in charge of designing and creating websites that can be used by as many people, regardless of their abilities.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a caption on the video raised eyebrows in this article. This is a major critical accessibility issue, as it can make it difficult or impossible for people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the content of a video. Even though it is a useful feature that can be used by normal people; if users are in a place where they can hear content over voice, they can read and understand what it is all about. As a result, web developers must ensure that all videos on their websites include captions or subtitles or provide a transcript of the content. Currently, in the market, multiple software and third-party captioning services are available that integrate captioning capabilities into the video player. Also, sometimes auto-captioning is not accurate, but sometimes something is better than nothing.\r\n\r\nAnother key issue highlighted in the article is the importance of clear, simple, and well-organized content. This includes using subheadings, bullet points, and shorter paragraphs to make the text easier to read and understand, it also helps to create a better user experience. In addition, the web developer must ensure that the font size and colour contrast are appropriate for users with low vision and that the website can be navigated using a keyboard too. Also, we have to keep in mind that our website can zoom in, which will help people with low-vision. So, this feature will provide a broad option for users and improve the accessibility of a website, particularly for people with cognitive disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis article shows the importance of avoiding overly complex or distracting design elements, such as animations and bright color schemes. While these features may be visually appealing, they can be difficult for some users to navigate or process. As such, web developers must strike a balance between aesthetics and usability, and consider the needs of all users when designing their websites. This article also highlights the issue with CAPTCHAs, which can be a significant barrier to accessibility for users with visual impairments or learning disabilities; they can consider alternative solutions such as audio CAPTCHAs or another form of verification.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the article is highly relevant to web development, as it highlights several critical issues that impact the accessibility of websites and web applications. By considering these issues and implementing best practices for accessibility, web developers can create websites that are more usable and inclusive for all users, regardless of their abilities.","image":null,"link":"https:\/\/axesslab.com\/accessibility-according-to-pwd\/","created_at":"2023-04-15 16:37:43","updated_at":"2023-04-15 16:37:43"}
